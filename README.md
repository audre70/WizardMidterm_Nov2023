# WizardMidterm_Nov2023

This was a midterm project for DM-UY1133 Creative Coding. My concept was an audiovisual sketch of a Wizard with the ability to cast different spell animations/scenes based on user interaction.

The goal of this project was to make our own interactive, screen based artwork. This project was an opportunity to demonstrate competency in the fundamentals of programming in p5.js. The requirements were to include at least one object, one class, and one method.
